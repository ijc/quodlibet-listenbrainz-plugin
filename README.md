A [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org/) submission plugin for the [QuodLibet](https://github.com/quodlibet/quodlibet) music player.

To install copy `*.py` to a subdirectory of `~/.quodlibet/plugins` (e.g. `~/.quodlibet/plugins/listenbrainz/`).

You will need to configure with your submission token which you can find in your [ListenBrainz profile](https://listenbrainz.org/profile/).

Remember that all of your "listens" will be public!

New code here is licensed under the same GPLv2 license as QuodLibet with the intention that it might one day be suitable for inclusion upstream. However `listenbrainz.py` remains under the MIT license.
